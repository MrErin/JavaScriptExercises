1. A Contact component that displays a person's name, phone number, and address.
1. A ContactList component that displays all contacts. It should import the Contact component and the ContactCollection component.
1. A ContactForm component that, when filled out and a submit button is pressed, adds a new contact to storage. It should import the ContactCollection component.
1. In main.js, import the ContactList component and the ContactForm component.
