# Honest Abe API

## Requirements:

Create an API using json-server for the resources you created above to track campaign contributions.

## Currently Working On:

## Remaining Features:

1. Use jQuery's $.ajax() method to get all of the related data to build a card for each politician. It should list the bills they have sponsored, and any companies that have contributed to a PAC that has a shared interest for each bill.

## Stretch Goals:

## Completed Features:

1. Create a db.json file containing all of the resources.
1. Define a few entries for each resource. Each resource must have a unique primary key.
1. Run your API with the following command.

```bash
json-server --watch db.json
```

1. Establish relationships between the resources by storing primary key values as foreign keys on related objects.
